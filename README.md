## HRI User Study Build

### Assumptions Made
To help speed up the process, the following assumptions are made:
  * The OS is up to date & all necessary packages are installed
  * The correct version of CMake exists on the system
  * No software builds will be done as it is a very time consuming process. Instead, the Realsense sdk and ROS2 will be pre-built.
