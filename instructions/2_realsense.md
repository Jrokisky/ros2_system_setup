# Setting up the Intel Realsense SDK

## Background Information
The Intel Realsense SDK is a multi-platform library for working with various Intel Realsense depth cameras.

## Instructions

### Building CMake
  * We may need to build CMake as the librealsense library notes:

      > Cmake Note: certain librealsense CMAKE flags (e.g. CUDA) require version 3.8+ which is currently not made available via apt manager for Ubuntu LTS.

* To check your CMake version: `cmake --version`
  * If it is not >= 3.8, you will need to build it:
    * download the [CMake Source][3] 
    * follow the installation instructions [here][4]
    * Run `./bootstrap -- -DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=ON` as ros2 requires [this][8]

### Getting the Installation docs
  * Navigate to the Intel Realsense sdk [repo][1]
  * Open: */docs*
  * Notice that there is a Jetson specific installation: *installation_jetson.md*. As of March 23 2019, we do not want to follow the instructions here, as they are out of date.
  * Instead, we are going to follow the general ubuntu build [instructions][2] (with some modifications)

### Building the library
  * Follow the [instructions][2], while making the modifications below.
  * Modifications: **Prepare Linux Backend and the Dev. Environment** 
    * Step 4: we are going to skip this step and not patch the kernel.
      * As noted in this [discussion][5] the patch is not required.
      * As we are running on a non-supported kernel (4.9), the patching scripts will not work.
      * If desired, you could build probably patch the 4.9 kernel on the TX2 by following what [JetsonHacks][6] does to get the d435i working on the Xavier.
  * Modifications: **Building Librealsense2 SDK**
      * When running cmake, we want to run `cmake ../ -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true -DFORCE_LIBUVC=true -DBUILD_WITH_CUDA=true`
        * You can read more about the build flags [here][7]
        * We are using the `FORCE_LIBUVC` flag as we did not patch the kernel.

### Testing Installation
  * Now that the software is built and installed, we can run the realsense-viewer
    * Run `realsense-viewer`
    * When the application is launched, changed the *Stereo Module* settings to:
      * Resolution: 640 x 480
      * FPS: 6
    * Turn on the Stereo Module
